# Fuel System Task Plan

This document contains bite-sized tasks for improving the fuel management system. Check off items as they are completed.

## ReserveFuel Controller Improvements

### Logging Enhancements
- [ ] Add detailed logging at the start of each public method in reserveFuel.controller.ts
- [ ] Add logging for MRN swap operations with before/after states
- [ ] Log specific error details in catch blocks
- [ ] Add transaction IDs to logs for tracing operations across controllers
- [ ] Implement log rotation to prevent log files from growing too large

### Error Handling
- [ ] Add specific error types for different failure scenarios
- [ ] Update catch blocks with error type checking
- [ ] Add user-friendly error messages for common failures
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation for non-critical errors
- [ ] Add telemetry for tracking error frequency

### Transaction Management
- [ ] Review all operations for proper transaction boundaries
- [ ] Ensure all multi-step operations use Prisma transactions
- [ ] Add rollback logging to track failed transactions
- [ ] Test transaction isolation under concurrent operations
- [ ] Ensure transaction timeouts are properly handled

### ExcessFuelExchangeService Integration
- [ ] Check integration between reserveFuel.controller.ts and excessFuelExchangeService
- [ ] Fix or implement processExcessFuelExchange function call with proper MRN handling
- [ ] Add logging to debug input/output of exchange service
- [ ] Create tests for the exchange service with various scenarios
- [ ] Add monitoring for exchange operations

### Automatic Fuel Swapping Implementation
- [ ] Fix or implement automatic swapping of excess fuel with oldest MRN
- [ ] Ensure swapping maintains correct MRN records
- [ ] Add validation to prevent invalid swapping operations
- [ ] Create a dashboard to monitor swap operations
- [ ] Implement notifications for large or unusual swap operations

## Density and MRN Management

### Density Calculation Standardization
- [ ] Create utility functions for standardized density calculations
- [ ] Replace direct calculations in controllers with these utility functions
- [ ] Add validation to ensure density values are within expected ranges
- [ ] Create unit tests for density conversion functions
- [ ] Add logging for unusual density values

### MRN Zero KG with Remaining Liters
- [ ] Implement detection for MRN records with zero KG but non-zero liters
- [ ] Create automatic reconciliation for these discrepancies
- [ ] Add alerts for frequent discrepancies
- [ ] Create admin interface for manual reconciliation
- [ ] Add audit logging for all reconciliation operations

### FIFO Implementation
- [ ] Create centralized FIFO service for consistent application
- [ ] Update all controllers to use this service
- [ ] Add validation to ensure FIFO is correctly applied
- [ ] Create reports to audit FIFO compliance
- [ ] Add tests for FIFO operations with various scenarios

## Mobile Cistern Management

### Synchronization Improvements
- [ ] Review and fix synchronization between fuelTankController and reserveFuel controllers
- [ ] Implement automatic synchronization triggers
- [ ] Add logging for synchronization operations
- [ ] Create alerts for failed synchronizations
- [ ] Add manual synchronization option for administrators

### MRN Breakdown Standardization
- [ ] Define standard structure for MRN breakdown data
- [ ] Update all controllers to use this structure
- [ ] Add validation for MRN data format
- [ ] Migrate existing data to new format if needed
- [ ] Add version property to MRN records for future compatibility

## Database and Data Integrity

### Prisma Type Safety
- [ ] Replace `prisma as any` with proper type definitions
- [ ] Add custom types for extended Prisma models
- [ ] Create interfaces for consistent cross-controller usage
- [ ] Update all controllers to use proper types
- [ ] Add runtime type validation where needed

### Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Create unit tests for reserveFuel controller
- [ ] Create integration tests for the entire fuel flow
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting
- [ ] Set up automated testing in CI/CD
- [ ] Create test fixtures for common scenarios

## Additional Improvements

### UI Enhancements
- [ ] Add visualization for fuel flow and MRN status
- [ ] Improve error reporting in UI
- [ ] Create admin dashboard for fuel management
- [ ] Add alerts for critical conditions
- [ ] Improve user feedback during operations

### Documentation
- [ ] Create developer documentation for the fuel system
- [ ] Add inline documentation to complex functions
- [ ] Create user manual for operators
- [ ] Document common troubleshooting steps
- [ ] Create architecture diagrams

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Profile and optimize database queries
- [ ] Add appropriate indexes
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Optimize large transactions
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
